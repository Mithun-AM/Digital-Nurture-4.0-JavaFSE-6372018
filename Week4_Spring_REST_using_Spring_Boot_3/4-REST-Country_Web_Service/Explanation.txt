1. What happens in the controller method?

- @RestController tells Spring to return response as JSON directly.

- @RequestMapping("/country") maps the URL to this method.

Inside the method:

  - A Spring context is loaded from country.xml.
  - The country bean is fetched (Country country = context.getBean(...)).
  - That object is returned.


2. How the bean is converted into JSON reponse?

- Spring Boot includes Jackson (from spring-boot-starter-web).
- Jackson automatically converts the Country object into a JSON structure.
- It uses getters (getCode(), getName()) to form:
{
  "code": "IN",
  "name": "India"
}

3. In network tab of developer tools show the HTTP header details received
