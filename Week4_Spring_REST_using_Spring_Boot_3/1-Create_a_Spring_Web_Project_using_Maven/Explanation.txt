1. src/main/java – Folder with application code

	This folder contains all the main Java source code for the application. It includes the SpringLearnApplication class and any other components like controllers, services, and models.

2. src/main/resources – Folder for application configuration

	This is where all configuration files live. The most common is application.properties or application.yml, used to define server ports, logging levels, and database configurations.

3. src/test/java – Folder with test code

	This folder is for unit and integration tests. It follows the same package structure as main/java. IntelliJ/Eclipse and Maven recognize this as the test source directory.

4. SpringLearnApplication.java – Main method walkthrough

	This is the entry point of the Spring Boot application. The main() method calls SpringApplication.run(), which bootstraps the application and starts the embedded Tomcat server.

5. Purpose of @SpringBootApplication

	This annotation is a convenience annotation that combines:

	@Configuration – makes this class a source of bean definitions

	@EnableAutoConfiguration – tells Spring Boot to auto-configure the app based on dependencies

	@ComponentScan – enables component scanning in the package and sub-packages

6. pom.xml

 A. Walkthrough of XML configuration
	This file defines project dependencies, plugins, Java version, group ID, and artifact ID. Maven uses this file to build the project and manage libraries.

 B. Dependency Hierarchy
	This view shows all direct and transitive dependencies in a tree structure. It's useful for resolving version conflicts and understanding which libraries are included.
